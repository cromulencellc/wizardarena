OLD instructions:
NOTE: This does not generate a validate server/client certificate which is required!

Create a certificate instruction

Sign a CSR with the CA Cert
This CA cert is for the game host

It will placed on all the machines to setup the chain of trust
*** MAKE SURE to secure consul, docker agents, swarm manager, and private registry
***** MIGHT WANT TO ADD Firewall rules to ensure everything is secured

Steps to generate a new CERT (agent1 for instance)
openssl genrsa -out agent1.key 2048
openssl req -new -key agent1.key -out agent1.csr

<<ENTER DATA make sure FQDN matches hostname of agent1>>

openssl x509 -req -in agent1.csr -CA ca_cert/rootCA.pem -CAkey ca_cert/rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out agent1.crt -days 365 -sha256

Your new cert is created.
Move it to the appropriate folders


Creating the CA certificate:
Create root key:
openssl genrsa -out ca_cert/rootCA.key 2048

Create self signed certificate
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca_cert/rootCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out ca_cert/rootCA.crt
