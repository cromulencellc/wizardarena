NOTES with ENGINE

If you run into database errors after updating the database... remember the engine uses a different user (engine for Postgres).

Update roles for the engine!
ALTER default privileges in schema public GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on tables TO engine;
ALTER default privileges in schema public GRANT select, usage on sequences to engine;
