## seeding

`mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs` is how you seed. It tries to be non-destructive.
Don't run it in production though. Re-seeding requires deleting the uploaded
file directory and hosing out the database.

It pulls team data from `priv/repo/teams.tsv`

## old stuff

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
